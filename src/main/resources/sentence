I don’t care   that they stole my idea…  I      care that they don’t have any of their own.
Of       all   things,       I     liked books best.
Let             the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments.
The present is theirs; the future,          for which I have really worked, is mine.
I do not think you can name         many great inventions       that have been made by married men.
If  your hate        could be turned        into electricity,       it would light up the whole world.
